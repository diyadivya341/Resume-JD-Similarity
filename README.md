# Resume-JD-Similarity using Generative AI

📌 Project Summary:
This project builds an interactive Streamlit web application that compares a candidate’s resume with a job description (JD) to calculate their similarity score. It leverages state-of-the-art sentence transformers to help job seekers tailor resumes by highlighting how closely their skills and experience match the job requirements.

The app accepts resume and JD files (PDF or DOCX), extracts and cleans the text, and computes a similarity score using cosine similarity of embeddings generated by a pretrained model (all-MiniLM-L6-v2).

📂 Dataset / Inputs:

- Candidate Resume (PDF)

- Job Description (PDF or DOCX)

Text is extracted and preprocessed for comparison.

# 🛠️ Technologies Used:

Python Libraries: Streamlit, pdfplumber, python-docx, sentence-transformers, nltk, re

Sentence Transformers (NLP embedding model)

Streamlit (UI and deployment)

# 🛠️ Project Workflow:

Upload resume and job description documents via the Streamlit UI

Extract text from PDFs or DOCX files

Clean and preprocess text by removing punctuation and lowercasing

Generate embeddings for resume and JD texts using a pretrained sentence transformer

Calculate cosine similarity between embeddings to get a similarity score

Display the similarity score interactively to users

🧠 Key Features:

- Supports PDF and DOCX formats for resume and JD uploads

- Uses a powerful sentence transformer model for semantic similarity

- Provides an intuitive web interface with Streamlit

- Enables job seekers to gauge how well their resume matches a specific job

- Helps tailor resumes for ATS optimization and better interview chances
